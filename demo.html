				<h3 style="color: greenyellow;">So, what's the main idea?</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>Very Simple!</h3>
				<h5>To allow people to play board games at their convenient</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						time and
					</li>
					<li>
						location
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 style="color: greenyellow;">How does the app work?</h3>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>As a new user, you'd register first, create your profile with information on what board games you like,
						your location and your avatar</li>
					<br>
					<li>Create an event with what you want to play, when, where and how many people can play the game</li>
					<br>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 style="color: greenyellow;">How does the app work?</h3>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Once you posted an event, other users can comment, RSVP, see the location on Google Maps</li>
					<br>
					<li>You, as a user, can update or delete your profile, delete any event any created</li>
					<br>
					<li>View other players and their favorite games as well</li>

				<section id="fragments">
					<h4>Technologies Used for onBoard</h4>
					<p>onBoard uses Mongo Express React and Node app as our base</p>
					<p> New technologies we used:</p>
					<p class="fragment">Redux</p>
					<p><span class="fragment">JSON Web Token, </span> <span class="fragment">bcrypt, </span> <span
							class="fragment">gravatar</span></p>

					<aside class="notes">
						This slide has fragments which are also stepped through in the notes window.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Redux</h2>
					<p>As our app got more complex managing the state felt messy and overwhelming. Using Redux for state
						management made it easier to maintain state across our app.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">As a personal goal I wanted to use this and understand it more </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>JSON Web Token(JWT) and bcrypt</h4>
					<p class="fragment fade-in"> JWT:</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">After logging in, each subsequent request will include the JWT,
						allowing the user to access routes, services,
						and resources that are permitted with that token.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">bcrypt:</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">This was used to hash the password in our database so passwords
						werent being stored directly to our database.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Gravatar</h4>
					<p class="fragment fade-in"> or Globally Recognized Avatar: </p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">This was a fairly easy way to imort profile pictures to our site.
						The user uploads an image and creates a profile just once, and then when you participate in any
						Gravatar-enabled site, your
						Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users. It is
						automatically included in every WordPress.com
						account and is run and supported by Automattic.</p>

			<!-- Andrew's Bit -->
			<section>
				<h2 style="color: red">Problems We Encountered</h2>
					<p>Most of our Problems came with getting familar with Redux.  Specfically Google Maps was a Challenge</p>
					<p>Another challenge that we came across was the occasional problem with merge conflicts.  These were overcome with good comuncation and teamwork.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 style="color: red">Other Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the other major problems we enountered was a multidude of different Heroku errors.</p>
					<P>These proved to be a big challenge due to the diffuclty of trying to cipher what Heroku logs was actually saying.</P>
